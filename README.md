## The Data Geneneration Model (DGM)

The DGM is a fishery simulation tool written in VB on contract to the Pacific Salmon Commission's (www.psc.org) Chinook Technical Committee (CTC). The code is written in Visual Basic and prepared to model population biology and fisheries somewhat specific to chinook salmon. 

A draft file of questions for Li, regarding the DGM, is in the [questions folder](docs/questions).

A draft file of scenarios to test is in the [scenario planning folder](docs/scenario_discussion).

Some basic documentation on the DGM is included in the pdf files found in [the manuals folder](docs/manuals).

If you're looking for tips on writing markdown, look in the [markdown guides folder](docs\markdown_guides).

Hopefully more to come, based on the recommended style guide below.
