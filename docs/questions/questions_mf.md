## questions to be added to Catarina's document
1. The dbase has referential integrity in place. Deleting data (eg stocks) will then result in cascade deletions. If the user relies on csv files then cascade deletion won't happen. Will the dgm function ok if there is orphaned data in the csv file approach?
